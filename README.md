# READ THIS:

There a lot of things that still need to be changed that make this most comprehensible engine.

A couple things:
- Some of the code needs to be refactored to make more sense. (Game state functions)
- Database things need to be centralized and made easier.
- A lot of code still needs to be documented.
- A lot of API subsets need to be finished.
